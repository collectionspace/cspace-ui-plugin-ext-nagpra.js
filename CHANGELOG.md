## v2.0.0

v2.0.0 adds support for CollectionSpace 7.2.

### Breaking Changes

- The record editor form for Object records now includes a new NAGPRA Note field (`nagpraNotes/nagpraNote`). To use this version of the NAGPRA extension with an older CollectionSpace server, the NAGPRA Note field should be hidden; otherwise, any values entered will not be saved.
